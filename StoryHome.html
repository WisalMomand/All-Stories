    <h2>Thirsty Crow Story</h2>
    <h3> A Tale of Ingenuity and Persistence</h3>
    <p class="container-fluid "> The Thirsty Crow:

        Once upon a time, during a hot and dry summer, a thirsty crow flew across the land in search of water. The streams and ponds had dried up, and the crow grew increasingly desperate as it scoured the barren landscape. After a long, tiring search, it finally spotted a pitcher lying near a deserted village. Hopeful, the crow flew down to investigate.
        
        Peering into the pitcher, the crow saw that there was a small amount of water at the bottom. The crow tried to reach it with its beak, but the neck of the pitcher was too narrow and the water too low. Frustrated but not willing to give up, the crow sat down to think.
        
        After some contemplation, the crow noticed a pile of pebbles nearby. An idea struck it.</p>

        <p class="float-end"> The crow picked up a pebble with its beak and dropped it into the pitcher. As the pebble hit the bottom, the water level rose slightly. Encouraged, the crow continued to drop more pebbles into the pitcher, one by one. Slowly but surely, the water level kept rising until it was within reach.
        
            With a final pebble, the water level was high enough for the crow to drink. It quenched its thirst, feeling relieved and satisfied. The crow then flew away, leaving the pitcher as a testament to its cleverness and determination.
            
            This story teaches us the importance of persistence and ingenuity. When faced with a challenge, thinking creatively and persevering can help us find a solution, no matter how difficult the problem may seem.</p></div>
